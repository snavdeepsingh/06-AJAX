### Giphy API
## CARTOONIST 

 I created a Cartoonist Fun App full of gifs using the giphy api!!!
 
 Here is the documentation for the Giphy API: https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI
I made an array of actions and made buttons out of them.
- When you click on a button, 10 images are retrieved from giphy and displayed on the page.
- When you click on the image, the gif plays. When you click again, the gif stops playing.
- You can add a new action from the form on the right side of the page. The actions will be added to the array of actions and added as a new button
- The rating of each gif will also appear on the page.
